**Describe the problem**
A clear and concise description of which parts of the app don't work and what you have to do to get there. Feel free to add screenshots in your description. This section is immensely useful for the person that tries to find the root checks and remove them.

**Describe preconditions for using the app**
A clear and concise description of requirements to use the app and get to the point where it doesn't work anymore. For example, do you need a passport issued in a specific country? Do you have to be registered at a local authority? Do you need an account, and if yes, how do you get it?

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions you've considered. For example, did you already try generic root check bypass modules like [BypassRootCheckPro](https://github.com/domyn/BypassRootCheckPro)?

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the app to be supported here.

**Fine print**
